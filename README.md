Kaggle Challenge : https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

A jupyter notenook containg all the preprocessing and model implementation steps
* Identified important features using correlation heat-map.
* normalised the important features and removed the skewness
* Used Gradient Boosting Regressor to build the model
* Perform grid search to tune the hyper parameters : n_estimators,max_depth,learning_rate
